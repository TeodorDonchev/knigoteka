You can also help out other people by posting your favourite books and your opinion on them. In order to post a book, you will need to create or login to your account. When you are in your account, you can keep track of the books you've posted and the amount of likes you have collected. You can also delete and edit your posted books and like others people's posted books. The books with the most likes are listed first and the top 3 are featured on the home page.
